# ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Support Engineer Labs Portfolio

Welcome to my hands-on lab portfolio designed to showcase my practical skills as an aspiring **Cloud Support Engineer**. Each lab simulates a real-world customer issue that might be faced in a Tier 1‚Äì2 cloud support role. Labs are written as realistic ticket scenarios with full resolution steps, internal documentation, and client communication ‚Äî just like in a real Managed Service Provider (MSP) environment.

## üß† Why I Built This

I'm pursuing a career as a Cloud Support Engineer and wanted to go beyond certifications to build a body of evidence that reflects **how I think and how I solve problems**. These labs simulate real support scenarios ‚Äî the kind of issues Tier 1 and Tier 2 engineers face every day ‚Äî and show how I‚Äôd respond, fix, and follow up professionally.
